The other images are from Hewlett Packard and exemplify the use of the
HalftoneHints tag (in their words):

The images are all the same subject, and should all appear the same
after rendering.  Each of the images is slightly different as outlined
by the following table:

   FileName	   ToneRange  HalftoneHints
jim___cg.tif      A	    Y
jim___dg.tif      B	    N
jim___gg.tif      B	    Y

The images with tone range A are 0-100% linear reflectance images,
in other words, fixed full gamut tone range.  The images with tone
range B are what we call "normalized", meaning that the image has
been tone adjusted such the Highlight and Shadow are at gray levels
1 & 2**BitsPerSample-2.

Each of the three grayscale images should be rendered to look like
the halftone in jim___ah.tif when printed on a Canon SX engine.
